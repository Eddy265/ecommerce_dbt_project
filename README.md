# Project Description: Ecommerce Data Processing and Analysis with dbt

This project showcases a comprehensive data processing and analysis workflow using dbt (data build tool), a powerful SQL-based data transformation and modeling tool. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how dbt can be utilized to efficiently process, clean, transform, aggregate, and analyze data from various database tables.

Data Source:
The project utilizes data from multiple tables, including "accounts," "orders," "web_events," "region," and "sales_reps." Each table contains valuable information about customers, sales transactions, web events, regions, and sales representatives.

Data Processing Tasks:
The project covers a range of data processing tasks, including:

Data Transformation: Standardizing date formats, cleaning text fields, handling missing values, categorizing data based on specific criteria, and calculating derived metrics like customer lifetime value and average order value.
Data Aggregation: Summarizing data using grouping and time-based aggregations to gain insights into sales performance and trends.
Data Quality Checks: Identifying and handling duplicates, verifying data ranges, and monitoring data completeness to ensure data accuracy.
Data Cleaning: Handling outliers, resolving missing data, and performing data deduplication for cleaner datasets.
Implementation:
The project showcases the implementation of each data processing task using SQL queries within dbt models. The models encapsulate the logic for data transformations, aggregations, and data quality checks, which collectively form a data pipeline for generating clean and structured data.

Business Insights:
By executing the dbt models, we can generate data lineage documentation and validate the data processing pipeline against the latest changes to the source data. The insights derived from this project enable data-driven decision-making, such as identifying top-performing sales representatives, customer segments, and regional sales trends.

By leveraging dbt for data processing and analysis, this project demonstrates how to turn raw data into actionable insights, enabling businesses to optimize sales strategies, understand customer behavior, and make informed decisions based on accurate and well-structured data.
